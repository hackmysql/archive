mysqlreport changelog

v3.5 April 16 2008
- Fixed bug: incorrect checking of MySQL version caused mysqlreport to
  ignore InnoDB status values in some cases. Simplified version from 3
  integers (major, minor, patch) to 1 (50024 = 5.0.24, 60001 = 6.0.1, etc.)
  for easier, more accurate version checking all around.
- Fixed potential bug: read_relative_infiles might have incorrectly
  divided infiles with multiple status value sets.
- Fixed bug: if wait_timeout was greater than --relative, mysqlreport
  would lose its connection while sleeping. Now the connection is closed
  and reopened for each live relative report collection.
- Infiles can now be given SHOW VARIABLES output (in addition to the
  old method of inserting values manually like: key_buffer_size=128M)
- Slow query time is beautified for microsecond, millisecond, and second
  resolution (format_u_time):
    0.000000 - 0.000999 = 0 - 999 µ
    0.001000 - 0.999999 = 1 ms - 999.999 ms
    1.000000 - n.nnnnnn = 1 s - n.nnnnn s
- Added a lot more debugging output.

v3.4a January 23 2008
- Fixed bug: InnoDB report values were wrong in relative reports because
  13 InnoDB status values needed to be excluded from being made relative.
  (thanks Debbie)
- Changed InnoDB Buffer Pool Read ratio to Read hit %

v3.4 January 20 2008
- Fixed bug: --relative infiles wouldn't work unless the SHOW STATUS
  values were prefixed with a line matching: /Variable_name[\s|]+Value/ 
  Now mysqlreport looks for Aborted_clients which should always be present.
  (thanks Debbie)
- Fixed formatting problem: tmp_table_size was too small for >99M
- Removed redundant %Total: column label from Slow line
- Added more debug info

v3.3 January 8 2008
- --all is now default operation; removed all "extra report" options
  like --dms, --sas, --qcache, etc.
- Slow line now displays long_query_time and log_slow_queries
- Created Temp Table line now displays tmp_table_size
- mysqlreport now extracts into its own directory

v3.2 May 26 2007
- Added --relative, --report-count, and --detach
- Changed Key read and write from ratios to hit %

v3.1 Apr 24 2007
- Added support for table_open_cache system var (MySQL 5.1.3+)
- Removed default assignments for $mycnf{'host'}, $mycnf{'port'}, and
  $mycnf{'socket'}.
- Connecting to MySQL now tries socket if one is given and actually
  a socket, else TCP/IP host if one is given, else generic "host=localhost"
  which relies on the MySQL client lib to do something useful.
- Updated help for clarity.
- Fixed bug: spelled "fsync" wrong

v3.0a Dec 12 2006
- Fixed bug on line 93: chomperc($mycnf{'pass'} = <STDIN>);
  supposed to be chomp($mycnf{'pass'} = <STDIN>); (thanks jeroen)

v3.0 Dec 8 2006
- Added reports for Innodb values with -innodb, -innodb-only, and -dpr options
- Added host from which report is on to subject line of email when report is
  emailed with -email (thanks Anthony)
- Increased read/write ratios from 0.00 to 0.000, decreased per/second vals
  from 0.00/s to 0.0/s

v2.8 and v2.9 ?
(Skipped because "three-point-oh" sounds nice.)

v2.7a Nov 15 2006
- Fixed bug: --host was completely ignored if a socket was available (thanks Sam)

v2.7 Oct 22 2006
- Option "password" in ~/.my.cnf now recognized (used to be that only "pass" was recognized)
- Options host, port, and socket now recognized in ~/.my.cnf
- Given those two changes, the order of option precendece is such that ~/.my.cnf is read
  first, then command line options override ~/.my.cnf options, and if nothing else default
  values are assigned
- --all actually shows all reports now (i.e. no more need to --all --tab)
- Like mytop, mysqlreport tries to connect via a socket first, otherwise it tries via a
  network connection
                
v2.6 Sep 3 2006
- Added -socket option (thanks to Christian for the patch)
- Use File::Temp instead of /tmp/mysqlreport.$$ (thanks to Christian for the patch)

- Renamed most of the reports

v2.1 Sep 13 2005
